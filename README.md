# Error Propagation in Node.js Callbacks

Using callbacks in JavaScript is a common practice for developers, particularly in Node.js environments. However, it's crucial to recognize a significant distinction between asynchronous callbacks, which handle the results of asynchronous operations, and synchronous callbacks, such as those utilized in methods like `map` or `forEach` for iterating over arrays, or event handlers within an event emitter.

While synchronous callbacks may handle errors or results straightforwardly due to their synchronous nature, asynchronous callbacks necessitate a different approach. Despite the V8 engine's understanding of our intentions and its lack of complaints, it's important to adhere to established conventions.

Henceforth, it's imperative to employ a separate callback for propagating errors or results in asynchronous callbacks. This separation is especially vital when dealing with errors, as asynchronous operations often entail handling responses in APIs or performing further actions based on the results.
